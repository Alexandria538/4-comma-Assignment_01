  <h3 align="center">4-Comma: Recursive Fractals and Firefly</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Create a 4-Koma (Yonkoma) manga that explores or utilizes generative methods or AI tools. The comic should consist of 4 panels that effectively capture your narrative about the topic, concept, or the use of these tools. It can be illustrated, captured from a 3D animation, or generated. Be creative, artistic, and most importantly, have fun with the process!

*Fig. 1. This is my 4-comma, where a scientist character is trying to photograph a rare bird with his knowledge
and application of recursive fractals in nature which he applied to a camouflage outfit. He waits for 7 hours
and is irritated that it didn’t work, but unbeknownst to him, the rare bird has decided to use his hat as a
perch.*

## Abstract
Through an integrated workflow combining digital drawing techniques in Photoshop with strategic
elements generated through Adobe Firefly’s AI, I developed a hybrid creative pipeline that maintains
artistic control while leveraging AI-assisted iterations to enhance my comic’s visual narrative. This
creates a universal methodology that is adaptable to diverse artistic approaches.

## Introduction and Related Works

My interest in AI generative art as a creative tool has developed over the course of my college
education due to its quick evolution and endless opportunities to supplement artistic exploration. I
intend to use AI generations to supplement my design so I can evaluate artistic options and make
critical decisions more efficiently. Multiple studies have looked at “how creative AI tools such as
image generative AI tools can be applied in various creative stages” (Huang). Manga is an effective
medium to highlight this process due to its simplistic base, and versatility to various artistic styles.
I believe Adobe Firefly and Photoshop work as effective mediums due to their easy user interface,
diverse tool sets, and accessibility. “Creatively oriented artificial intelligence (AI). . . are subject
to continuous improvement. . . ” however there are common limitations such textual generation,
logical discrepancies, and lack of uniqueness (Angelova). There are countless available graphics
editors like Photoshop and both closed-sourced and open-sourced AI models to explore this method
of creative exploration. For example, “While closed-source Gen AI models still exhibit superior
performance compared to their open-source counterparts. . . this gap is steadily narrowing” (Chun
et al). Understanding your needs and the available options of the current market will help you find
the best programs to use.


## Methodology
The creative process begins with planning your composition in Photoshop, where you’ll design and
layout the content for each individual cell. An alternative approach is to hand-draw your content on
paper and digitize it through scanning, allowing for digital refinement afterward. Once your initial
design is complete, upload it to Adobe Firefly using the reference option for composition. This
powerful AI tool enables you to generate multiple variations of your artwork, exploring countless
different creative directions [Figure 2]. The generation process can vary in duration based on your
specific requirements, the complexity, and the fine tuning of your settings. Use the generated images
to update your artwork back in your editing software. You can iterate through the process multiple
times to achieve consistent styling and maintain visual harmony. While Photoshop is commonly
used for this workflow, other digital art software can also be employed for the initial creation and
manipulation phases. Through repeated experimentation with Firefly’s controls, you’ll develop a
deeper understanding of how to achieve your desired artistic style. This iterative process ensures
that all cells maintain stylistic cohesion while allowing for creative evolution. The combination
of traditional techniques and AI-assisted generation provides flexibility in achieving your artistic
vision.

*Fig. 2. Image generations from Adobe Firefly. The prompt I used was "a man in glasses in a camouflage suit
hiding in the bushes with a camera and binoculars", for cell 1 and "a bird with red feathers, big eyes and a big
beak with a plume like a crown" for the bird in Cell 4. [Red] Initial attempts for cell 1 generations did not
show much difference from straight generations without reference. Even generating with the distinction of
’art’ instead of ’photo’ produces near-realistic images. [Yellow] Stylistic exploration: Art, Simple, Fauvism,
Modern Art, Comic Book, Digital art (Increased Impact of my Composition reference based on sketches:
results in more abstracted images and patterns.) [Green] Stylistic exploration: Art, Simple, Fauvism, Modern
Art, Comic Book, Digital art (medium impact of Composition reference, see step 1 of Fig. 4.) [Blue]
Stylistic exploration: Same filters utilized as the Green group only using the secondary prompt.*

## Result and Future Work
I created a hand-drawn piece that matched my artistic vision yet explored more artistic avenues
within a reduced time limit, allowing for more development. Outside of shifting to grayscale, the
outcome matched my initial ideas. The process helped create a detailed environment, eliminate
unnecessary elements, and the appeal of the characters. Firefly proved valuable for creative exploration,
though I’d dedicate more time with manipulating the controls. The process showed me
that investigating different approaches is crucial for artistic development. I plan to continue using
Firefly for future projects, focusing on thorough exploration of its features to enhance my work.

*Fig. 3. Here is the creative progression for the bird character featured in cell 04 from the initial sketch to the
finished image [Step 4 and 5 cropped for viewing convenience].*

*Fig. 4. Here is the progression for cell 1 including initial sketching, character development, environmental
detailing, and text implementation. Note that the other three cells were alterations of this cell.*

## Conclusion
This method of integrating artistic practices with AI assistance has shown that automation has the
potential to enhance rather than replace creativity. The iterative process between Photoshop and
Firefly, and other similar programs, demonstrates how AI can spark new possibilities and accelerate
creative decision-making while maintaining artistic integrity.
